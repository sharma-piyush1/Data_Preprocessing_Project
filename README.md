# Data Preprocessing Template

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a general-purpose **data preprocessing pipeline** commonly used in machine learning workflows. It is for Linear Regression. The best thing of this Template is, that any one can use it for Data preprocessing. 

## 📌 Contents

- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization)
- Splitting dataset into training and test sets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 File Description

- `Data_preprocessing_template.ipynb`: A step-by-step notebook with all preprocessing techniques applied to a sample dataset.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data_Preprocessing_Project.git
   cd Data_Preprocessing_Project

2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code:
   Run this "jupyter notebook Data_preprocessing_template.ipynb"

3. Run all cells and explore the workflow.

## 📈 Use Case
This template is ideal for beginners and professionals alike who want a clean starting point for any machine learning pipeline.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
This notebook is part of my data science learning journey and is inspired by common preprocessing steps used in practical machine learning.
